# WeTechForward

**WeTechForward** is a platform designed to spread awareness about the importance of ethical and humane technology. The project explores the various ways in which technology can either help or harm society, emphasizing the critical need for ethical development and implementation in areas like artificial intelligence, social media, and virtual reality.

**Project Background**
This project was developed as part of the Kode With Klossy program, which empowers young individuals to explore technology and coding. Through this initiative, we aim to inspire others to think critically about the technologies they use daily and to advocate for ethical practices in tech development.

## Key Topics Covered

- **Humane Technology**:  
  Humane Technology refers to tech designed to help humans achieve their goals without exploiting them for profit. It focuses on ethics, social responsibility, and the positive impact technology can have when used correctly.  

- **Why We Need Humane Tech**:  
  As technology advances at an unprecedented pace, its impact on society becomes more complex. While we have gained significant advancements in connection, culture, and innovation, there are also risks to consider. WeTechForward aims to bring attention to some of these risks, including:

  - Gender Bias
  - Mental Health Impacts
  - Political Polarization
  - Privacy & Safety Concerns
  - Misinformation
  - Racial Discrimination

## Purpose

The goal of **WeTechForward** is to create awareness around the need for ethical, humane technology. As we build more advanced systems, it's essential that we consider their societal implications and work towards developing technologies that uplift humanity rather than causing harm.

## Features

- Clear definitions and examples of humane technology.
- An easy-to-understand breakdown of the risks posed by unethical technology.
- Links to external resources for deeper understanding of humane tech concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the webpage.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity to the site.
- **Graphics**: Various image assets to support the message.
